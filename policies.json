    "notes": "The Netherlands has tightened national export-control measures on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, aligning with security and strategic supply-chain concerns; as of 7 September 2024, the Dutch government expanded the national authorisation requirement so that more types of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (including measuring, inspection and lithography tools) must receive an export licence.  Earlier, on 1 April 2025, additional modifications came into effect requiring authorisation for more equipment types. These measures directly impact ASML, the world-leading supplier of lithography machines, which must now apply for Dutch export licences (rather than only US licences) for key systems.  The tightening aims to prevent unrestricted transfer of high-end chipmaking technology to China and other jurisdictions of concern, thereby preserving Dutch and European technological leadership and security",
